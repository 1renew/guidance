# treehealth-elm-prototype

## Goal
Our services support and incentivise woodland managers toward good behaviours which delivers resilient woodland landscape.

## Sprint questions
* Can we ensure that incentives are aligned across policy and services?
* How do we ensure we avoid unintended consequences in relation to improved woodland management?
* How do we correctly balance incentives for individual scenarios?
* What data do we need to make effective decisions?
* How do we i ntegrate data into our service?
* How do we build trust in our systemdwith iour users?
* What do we need to report on and to who?

## Hypothesis to test
In the event of a disease outbreak, if a woodland manager follows DEFRA recommendations their ELM payments will be maintained 

## Prototype scenario
Frank the farmer has completed a land management plan and has just had a tree disease diagnosed by the Forestry commision, what happens next?
* Non-commercial woodland
* Mixed woodland
* Computer literate
* Competent farm manager
* First time facing tree disease
* Receiving regular ELM payments
* 50% felling and restocking has been advised
